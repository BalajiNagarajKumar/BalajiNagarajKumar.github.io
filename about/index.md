I have completed my undergrad at SSN College of Engineering `(2011-2015)` majoring in  Electrical and Electronics. 
I plan on pursuing an MS in computer vision with applications focused on control systems, AI, 3D-reconstruction and robotics.

I am also one of  the core members of Electrical Research Fraternity (*ERF*). Follow the link to have a look at our achievements. During my free time I usually blog, write python automation scripts, read *manga* and practise the ancient martial arts of Silambam. To know more about me have a look at my [`resume`]({{site.url}}/assets/cv.pdf) or ping me at sibi dot vasank @gmail.com.
