I have completed my undergrad at SSN College of Engineering `(2011-2015)` majoring in  `Electrical and Electronics`.

I worked under the guidance of `Dr.M.Senthil Kumaran` in his kickass lab at SSNCE where I had the freedom to pursue my interests. 

I am also one of the core members of `Electrical Research Fraternity` (*ERF*). Follow the [link](http://www.erfssn.org/our-achievements/) to have a look at our achievements.

I plan on pursuing an MS in `computer vision` with applications focused on control systems, AI, 3D-reconstruction and robotics.

During my free time I usually blog, write python automation scripts, read
*manga* and practise the ancient martial arts of `Silambam`. To know more about me have a look at my [`resume`]({{site.url}}/assets/cv.pdf) or ping me at sibi dot vasank @gmail.com.
