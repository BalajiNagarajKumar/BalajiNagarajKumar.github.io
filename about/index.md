I have completed my undergrad at SSN College of Engineering `(2011-2015)` majoring in  `Electrical and Electronics`.

I worked under the guidance of [`Dr.M.Senthil Kumaran`](http://zentill.erfssn.org/) in his kickass lab at SSNCE where I had the leeway to explore and pursue my interests. 

I am also one of the core members of [`Electrical Research Fraternity`] (http://www.erfssn.org/our-achievements/). Follow the [link](http://www.erfssn.org/our-achievements/) to have a look at our achievements.

I plan on pursuing an MS in `computer vision` with applications focused on control systems, AI, 3D-reconstruction and robotics.

I script in nearly in all computer languages but python and c++ remains close to my heart because one has the shortest prototyping time and the other has the highest performance.

During my free time I usually blog, read *manga* or practise [`Silambam`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silambam). To know more about me have a look at my [`resume`]({{site.url}}/assets/cv.pdf) or ping me at sibi dot vasank @gmail.com.
