I have completed my undergrad at SSN College of Engineering `(*2011-2015*)` majoring in  Electrical and Electronics. 
I plan on pursuing an MS in computer vision with applications focused on control systems, AI, 3D-reconstruction and robotics.
I am a core member of Electrical Research Fraternity (*ERF*). Follow this link to look at our accomplishments [ERF Achievements]((http://www.erfssn.org/our-achievements/)). During my free time I usually blog, write python automation scripts, read *manga* and practise the ancient martial arts of Silambam. To know more about me have a look at my [`resume`]({{site.url}}/assets/cv.pdf) or ping me at sibi dot vasank @gmail.com.
