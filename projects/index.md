##Semi-Autonomous Control of Quadrotor
`mentor`- *Prof. V.Kamaraj (HOD EEE/SSNCE)* , outcome of my final year project.<br/>
`Team of two members`

* Responsible for implementation of the two-channel PID controller for roll and pitch control of a quadcopter
on Spartan 3E FPGA using Matlab/Xilinx(ISE).
* Aided in the indigenous construction of the quadcopter frame and interfacing of the 9 degree of freedom
inertial measurement unit with the FPGA.
* Aided in the testing and implementation of the control algorithm in arduino microcontroller.

##Modelling and Feedback Linearization of Aero-Thrust Pendulum
`mentor`- *Prof. M.Senthil Kumaran* (EEE/SSNCE)<br/>
`Team of two members`

* Responsible for implementation of the single-channel PID controller with anti-reset for aero-thrust pendulum
on Spartan 3E FPGA using Matlab/Xilinx(ISE)
* As a part of a team of two, implemented the data logging system on Spartan 3E FPGA interfaced to
Matlab through Real time Windows target and aided in feedback-linearization of the non-linear system.
* Facilitated the implementation of the online tuning of PID parameters with on-board switch of the FPGA.

##LOCK
 
######(Localization, Obstacle avoidance , Control and Kinematic framework) 
`mentor` - *Prof. M.Senthil Kumaran* (EEE/SSNCE)<br/>
`Team of three members`

* Implemented Localization and Pose estimation based on arbitrary defined color contours detection using
OpenCV C++ library.
* Implemented A* based search on the image to find the optimal path through a obstacle maze.
* Implemented a PID based control system based on the kinematics of the differential driving system.

##Magnetic Levitation System
`mentor` - *Prof. M.Senthil Kumaran* (EEE/SSNCE)
`Team of four members`

##Quickbot using Beaglebone Black
`Team of two members`

* As a team of two, implemented the quickbot and responsible for design of the three amps regulator circuit
using 7805 and callibrated the infrared proximity sensor.
* Compiled from source the wifi driver rtl8192E firmware on the debian distribution of the Beaglebone
black enabling wireless debugging of data.
* Tested various control theory concepts from PID control to hybrid automata model for switching between
various behaviour models.

##Space Invaders Game using TM4C123G

* Interfaced the cortex-M4 processor with the Nokia 5110 LCD display used to display the graphics required
for the game.
* Interfaced the microcontroller with a potentiometer which was used as a joystick to control the spaceship.
* Implemented the algorithm that provides for the joint operation of the DAC to produce the sound required
in adherence with Nyquist theorem and interrupt triggering of the entire game.

##Variegated Learner Anime Downloader(VLAD) using Wxpython

* Responsible for the download link extraction algorithm and multi-threaded downloader implementation.
* Implemented a GUI based data scraping, multithreaded downloader using WxPython for anime shows
and its source code was published in [github](https://github.com/QuinAsura/VLAD)
