> “Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible” 

This quote by [`Richard
Feynman`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), is primarily
responsible for my quest for experiencing the `aha` moment in every concept I
learn. The pure romance of `modeling` a physical systems in its entirety,
`realising` it from scratch and  `orchestrating` it to any desired eventuality through `code` gives me such a rush. 

This site serves the purpose of re-organizing my thoughts and helps me blog to
my heart's desire. To know more about me have a look at my
