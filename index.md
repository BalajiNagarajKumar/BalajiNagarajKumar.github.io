So far, My academic experience was prodigious, as *I focused in acquiring real knowledge in the original potential manner*. The Best Outgoing Student Award for my highest achievements in academics with 98.75% in high school majors – Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry blended with my love for engineering, helped me complete Bachelor’s degree program in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering** at **Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering (SSN)**, Anna University, Chennai. 

During my undergraduate experience, I apperceive that even though the developments in the electricity sector are exciting and interesting, the need for *innovation and efficient energy management* are the key to **sustainable electricity**. Thereby I foresee the advent of smart technologies into electricity sector will turn electricity as an *optimised and conveniently efficient system*. The recent advancements in artificial intelligence, optimisation algorithms etc., and their advent into electrical systems, firmly support my point. Therefore I aligned all my research activities towards contributing to smart electricity systems - more specifically in **control, power systems and sustainable electromobility**. 

I strongly believe my *well-knit understanding* towards electrical engineering, *reinforced research* through innovative projects & *the love* for entrepreneurship would enable myself as a **qualified engineer** both in fulfilling my motive and help achieving the sustainable future.


Combination of **Engineering**, **Innovation** and **Commercialization** in power and energy sector is what I am aspiring for in my future career.
